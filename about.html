            <h3>Welcome to Our Club,</h3>
            <p>The FLAME Swimming Club is a passionate and inclusive community within FLAME University, dedicated to promoting swimming as both a sport and a life skill. We welcome students of all skill levels — from beginners taking their first strokes to competitive swimmers preparing for major meets. Our club offers regular training sessions led by experienced coaches, access to well-maintained facilities, and opportunities to compete in friendly and professional environments. More than just a place to swim, the club serves as a platform for students to challenge themselves physically, build confidence, and develop essential traits like discipline, resilience, and teamwork.</p>
            <p>

                Beyond the pool, the FLAME Swimming Club actively works to cultivate a culture of fitness, camaraderie, and personal growth across campus. We host engaging events, organize workshops on technique and water safety, and create spaces where members can connect, support, and grow together. Our mission is to foster a community that not only excels in swimming but also embodies the spirit of sportsmanship and collective progress. With every dive, we strive to make waves — in skill, in spirit, and in the lives of our members.</p>
